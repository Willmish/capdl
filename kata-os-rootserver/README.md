# kata-os-rootserver: the Shodan/KataOS rootserver

Shodan is a project to build a low-power secure embeded platform
for Ambient ML applications. The target platform leverages
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) and [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/).

The Shodan
software includes a home-grown operating system named KataOS, that runs
on top of [seL4](https://github.com/seL4) and (ignoring the seL4 kernel)
is written almost entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is an alternative to the C-based capdl-loader-app included in the
seL4 CAmkES code base. kata-os-rootserver is written in Rust and supports
features needed by KataOS to support dynamic memory allocation and running
KataOS applications. kata-os-rootserver depends on code in the kata-os-common
crate(s); especially the kata-os-capdl and kata-os-model crates that implement
the bulk of capDL specification reading and processing (to instantiate a
running system).

kata-os-rootserver requires the seL4 kernel configuration. To do this it employs
the sel4-config build support and requires the SEL4_OUT_DIR environment variable
to find the kernel build artifacts.
